# Chronological:
- ## Getting a basic arm
    - [x] Confirm encoder works
    - [x] Confiroffset(~~straight down, towards robot~~ the arm at rest is represented by a 0 encoder). If it needs tuning, do so.
    - [x] Simple Percent Output to control arm
    - [ ] Encoder value at end, straight up, level
- ## Tuning for gravity
    - [ ] Create kF, arbitrary feedforward(Find power required to maintain position at 90Â°) and apply to arm power in update, which can be used by Percent Output with `m_talonSRX.(set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, [powerPercentage], DemandType.ArbitraryFeedForward, [feedForward source]);`)
- ## PID/MotionMagic
    - [ ] investigate need for velocity and acceleration constraints on the arm 
    - [ ] Create P value for arm
    - [ ] Implement motionmagic using PID alongside kF
