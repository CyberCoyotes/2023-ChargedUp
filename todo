- # New Post-Calvin Todo, everything done **before** W3 Traverse City
    - [ ] Re-measure constants
    - [ ] getting a consitent, one-meter auton in a straight line with standard swerve trajectories
    
    - [ ] A time based tracker for matches that diagnostics after the match on shuffleboard
    - [ ] Auton Chooser
    - [ ] PID control
    - [ ] PID control with input from gyro pitch.
    - [ ] Arm Extent Command for auton
    - [ ] Offsets; do as late as possible

# Chronological:
- ## Getting a basic arm
    - [x] Confirm encoder works
    - [x] Confiroffset(~~straight down, towards robot~~ the arm at rest is represented by a 0 encoder). If it needs tuning, do so.
    - [x] Simple Percent Output to control arm
    - [x] Encoder value at end, straight up, level
    - [x] Arm rotation soft limit
- ## Tuning for gravity
    - [ ] Create kF, arbitrary feedforward(Find power required to maintain position at 90Â°) and apply to arm power in update, which can be used by Percent Output with `m_talonSRX.(set(ControlMode.PercentOutput, [powerPercentage], DemandType.ArbitraryFeedForward, [feedForward source]);` that, or just brake the rotation motors.)
- ## PID/MotionMagic
    - [ ] investigate need for velocity and acceleration constraints on the arm 
    - [ ] Create P value for arm
    - [ ] Implement motionmagic using PID alongside kF
- ## Auton v1
    - [ ] Create basic auton paths, with commands and such 
- ## Auton v2
    - [ ] Attempt Pathplanner, while using cartesian coord method's errors to improve
