# 2023-FalconSwerve

Code repository for the 2023 FRC season. We are using Java (command based) for programming. On the hardware side we are using a RobioRio2, MK4 inverted swerve drive modules, primarily Falcon motors, and a Pigeon 2 gyro. Drive code is forked from FRC Team 364 "[Falcon Swevrve](https://github.com/team3640).
