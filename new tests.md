Please install Region viewer, if possible; it will make your life so much easier (mostly because you have to deal with me using it)

Also kindly document any changes you make to the code after this list

<ul>
    <li>
      Test the intake PWM. The port should be PWM 0. All of the prior <b>intake</b> buttons have been reassigned, hopefully, to serve the same purpose
    </li>
    <li>    
        Test the new auton; should currently drive to our nice setpoint, same as it did during comp, and then drive backwards until significant pitch change, effectively <b>driving forever backwards</b> on flat ground. A fear of mine is the robot still driving the wrong way(the same direction as it starts in) after the line cross portion of the auton, against the intent of the robot driving backwards to again reach the charging station.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test the new wrist, and find a good maximum speed. If you can, get virtual limits and speed settings dialed-in 
    </li>
     <li>
        Re-affirm prior functionality
    </li>
    
</ul>
